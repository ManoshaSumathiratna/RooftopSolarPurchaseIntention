<h1>Factors Influence The Purchase Intention Towards Rooftop Solar</h1>
<h4> (A Comparative study of a developed and a developing country) </h4>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p align="justify">
The primary objective of this study is to identify the key factors influencing purchase intention towards rooftop solar panels. The study was conducted as a comparison between Sri Lanka and the UK, which served as developing and developed countries. The conceptual foundation was built integrating, Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). As independent constructs, subjective norm, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and perceived behavioural control were considered while performance expectancy and attitude were considered as mediators. Income and education were considered additionally. Data analysis was performed using SPSS and SPSS AMOS using 246 and 194 responses from Sri Lanka and UK collected through a questionnaire respectively. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was performed to test the measurement model and Structural Equation Modelling was used to analyse the relationship. Effects of the mediators were assessed by serial mediation analysis using bootstrap technique. Direct effect of Perceived Behavioural Control was significant for Sri Lankans and Facilitating Conditions affected on UK residents’ purchase intention significantly. For both countries Subjective Norm and Effort Expectancy were having significant indirect effect on purchase intention through performance expectancy and attitude. The findings of the research can serve as suggestions for solar suppliers to design effective marketing strategies and segmentation. With a greater understanding of consumers' intentions to purchase solar panels, government can go forward with creating the necessary regulations and incentives to encourage public to adopt solar energy. Moderator analysis could be incorporated into the conceptual model by upcoming scholars. Future research should also be interesting to conduct a cost-benefit analysis and levelized cost of energy.

<h2> Population and Sample</h2>
<p align="justify">
In this study, all households in Sri Lanka and United Kingdom that do not currently have rooftop solar panels are the target population. The sample was taken with the non-probability convenience sampling approach. A total of 300 individuals from each country were selected to take part in the study. The questionnaire was distributed to those participants via electronically as well as printed questionnaire. As a result, 246 responses from Sri Lanka and 194 responses from the United Kingdom were able to collect, which showed 82% and 65% response rate from Sri Lanka and UK respectively.

<br/>
<h2> Data Analysis</h2>
<br/>

<h3> Model Fit</h3>
<p align="justify">
Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was computed for both samples separately using SPSS AMOS to test the measurement model. At the first stage, factor loadings were assessed for each indicator and one item (FC4) was removed from Sri Lanka model as the factor loading was less than 0.5 (>0.376). Moreover, the modification indices checked and refined the model by covariate error terms within indicators. The total goodness of fit of the model was evaluated using the model fit measures. The results shown in Table 4.1 confirms the good fit for both countries.

<br/>
<p align="justify">
The squared multiple correlations were 0.827 and 0.745 for PI (Purchase Intention) for Sri Lanka and UK for the above two models respectively. This indicates that 82.7% (for Sri Lanka) and 74.5% (for UK) variance of PI is explained by the six constructs (Subjective Norm, Effort Expectancy, Facilitating Conditions, Perceived Behavioural Control, Performance Expectancy and Attitude) in the model, which is well acceptable figure.
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Testing Direct Effects </h3>
<br/>
<p align="justify">
Table 4.7 illustrates the direct relationships between the independent and dependent constructs based on the structural model tested for Sri Lanka. It can be concluded that only PBC has a positive significant on PI, while the effects of SN, EE and FC on PI are not significant at 95% level of confidence for Sri Lankan residence.

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="justify">  
As per Table 4.8, FC has a positive significant impact on PI of rooftop solar of UK residents. However, none of the other three constructs showed significant impact on the PI.

<br/>
<br/>



<h3>Testing Mediation Effects </h3>
<br/>
<p align="justify">
To assess the serial mediating effect of PE and AT on the relationship between independent and dependent constructs, bootstrap technique was performed with 5000 number of bootstrap samples using SPSS AMOS. The results are shown in Table 4.8 and Table 4.9 for Sri Lanka and UK respectively.
<br/>
<br/>
According Table 4.9, serial mediating effects of PE and AT on the relationship between SN and PI, as well as EE and PI both found to be significant. Hence H5 and H6 hypotheses were supported for Sri Lankan residents.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="justify">  
Table 4.10 confirms the significant serial mediating effect of PE and AT on the relationship between SN - PI, and EE - PI. Hence, H5 and H6 hypotheses are accepted for UK residents.

<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Testing Demographic Variable Effects</h3>
<br/>
<p align="justify">
The significance of the impacts of income and education on PI towards rooftop solar for Sri Lankan households is shown in Table 4.11. Therefore, neither of the demographic components had a substantial effect on PI. Income and education have little to no impact on PI for UK residents too (Table 4.12).

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p align="justify">
This study intends to analyse the factors influencing rooftop solar purchasing intentions in Sri Lanka and the UK in the context of developing and developed countries given the relevance of solar energy as a reliable source of clean energy and a secure alternative for fossil fuels. The study revealed major distinctions between the two countries when considering constructs in the conceptual model.
<p align="justify">
Subjective Norm (SN) and Effort Expectancy (EE) do not significantly affect Purchase Intention (PI) towards rooftop solar for residents of Sri Lanka or the UK. However, for both Sri Lankan and UK citizens, the indirect impacts of SN and EE on the desire to purchase solar energy through the sequential mediating effect of Performance Expectancy (PE) and Attitude (AT) were substantial. 
<p align="justify">
These findings suggest that people's purchasing decisions are not directly influenced by others or their comfort level with solar energy, but rather through factors such as the ability to assess the benefits of solar energy use and their attitude towards it.
<p align="justify">
The Perceived Behavioural Control (PBC) was showing a positive direct effect on Purchase Intention (PI) of Sri Lankan residents, which is supported the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). This shows that consumers in Sri Lanka are more likely to show a favourable purchase intention if they feel they have the knowledge, skills, and resources needed to install, operate, and maintain rooftop solar systems.
<p align="justify">
The study's conclusions indicate that Facilitating Conditions (FC) significantly influence UK individuals' intentions to buy solar panels. This indicates that UK residents are more likely to purchase rooftop solar the better the enabling conditions. 
<p align="justify">
The practical application of this study can provide policymakers with suggestions on how to promote the usage of solar energy. A person in Sri Lanka is more likely to use solar energy if they are knowledgeable and have the skills necessary to install and maintain rooftop solar panels. Therefore, government agencies should concentrate more on educating the public about rooftop solar and ensuring that the companies that support it have the resources and skills required to keep providing for their clients. In countries like the UK, people are more focused on getting financial support, tax incentives, an easy process to get government approval to install solar panels on their rooftops, and having the space to do so. The government may work with financial institutions to create certain financial solutions to encourage more people to purchase solar panels. Additionally, marketers can come up with some innovative ideas for placing solar panels in small spaces as well as some advertising and marketing initiatives to raise awareness.

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p align="justify">
The study's findings could increase understanding, especially in terms of how beneficial they are. The study serves as a starting point for further research into the potential for solar energy in Sri Lanka and the UK. The research's importance is clear because the results can help solar power developers and marketers create efficient marketing strategies and enhance market segmentation. Additionally, authorities and decision-makers might use the research to educate the public, possibly through workshops and exhibition.
<p align="justify">
In Sri Lankan context, Perceived Behavioural Control has a significant impact on Purchase Intention. An individual's perception of their ability to accept and use solar technology successfully is reflected in their perceived behavioural control. Therefore, government officials and solar marketers can both greatly benefit from understanding the effects of perceived behavioural control. For instance, the government can design programmes to particularly address the barriers preventing consumers from adopting solar technology. Governments are able to more effectively distribute resources if they recognise the role of perceived behavioural control. Conversely, solar marketers can modify their marketing strategies to accommodate the unique challenges associated with perceived behavioural control. For instance, if a potential customer's lack of knowledge of is a barrier, they can create educational content and campaigns that empower them with knowledge.
In the UK context, Facilitating Conditions showed a significant direct influence on Purchase Intention. Thus, government of UK can think of providing financial supports such as low interest loan schemes as well as solar suppliers can offer installment basis purchasing options which can improve facilitating conditions. Further, solar panel installation can be financed by commercial banks as part of mortgage loans. Households can be given financial incentives from the government to buy solar panels. The government could offer more subsidies to the renewable energy industry to promote the development of sustainable energy. It can also give experts the chance to create new technologies and reduce taxes to lessen pressure on businesses to produce high-quality goods. If these solar energy technologies are affordable and robust, more people will be inclined to buy them.
<p align="justify">
Both countries discovered, Subjective Norm has a strong indirect impact on Purchase Intention via Performance Expectancy and Attitude. This insight is helpful for developing recommendations that can accelerate the installation of rooftop solar panels. Suppliers of solar power can use word-of-mouth advertising. They can develop referral programmes to reward current customers who refer new ones and can encourage satisfied solar panel users to share their experience with friends and family. Additionally, they can disseminate testimonials and success stories from local community who have adopted solar power. These will have a favourable effect on Performance Expectancy and Attitude which ultimately influence positively on rooftop solar Purchase Intention.
<p align="justify">
Through Performance Expectancy and Attitude, it was discovered that Effort Expectancy for both countries had an indirect impact on Purchase Intention. Effort Expectancy represents an individual's perception of the degree of effort or cognitive load necessary when utilising that technology to complete a particular activity. As a result, solar suppliers may consider simplifying the solar installation process. They can make investments in technology and processes that make solar panel installation as easy and hassle-free as feasible. Additionally, can provide comprehensive user manuals and installation tutorials. In order to lessen the perception of work associated with system setup and maintenance, make sure consumers have access to support and troubleshooting resources. 
<p align="justify">
Additionally, government and related parties can make an effort to improve Performance Expectations and Attitude to influence people' buying intentions. They can develop educational programmes that emphasise the tangible benefits of rooftop solar panels, such as cost savings on energy, a less contribution to the environment pollution, and higher property value. These advertising need to address both the economic and environmental benefits. By highlighting innovations in solar panel systems that enhance performance, efficiency, and reliability, they can demonstrate technological achievements. Emphasize how these advancements lead to a better overall experience for customers. On the other hand, government may establish an acceptable price policy for solar panels, offer tax benefits to users of solar panels, and invest in solar panel research. It will have a more favourable effect on customer Attitudes and solar panel Purchase Intentions.
<p align="justify">
Solar marketers and policy makers may capitalise on the unforeseen impacts of Subjective Norm and Effort Expectancy to encourage the adoption of rooftop solar by focusing on these suggestions. These tactics may establish trust, lower perceived barriers, and encourage favourable attitudes towards the installation of solar panels, ultimately leading to better adoption and purchase intention rates.

<h2>Limitations and Future Directions</h2>
<p align="justify">
There are certain restrictions on this study that are important to highlight. First off, a limited sample size was chosen, which has an effect on how generalizable the findings are. It is recommended using a larger sample size and more diversified responders. Second, because the researchers used convenience sampling to gather their data, there may be bias in the sample frame. Future studies might look at adopting a random sampling method to test the proposed model in order to get over this restriction. Thirdly, the current study integrated the TPB, TAM, and UTAUT theories and considered income and education into account as two additional demographic factors. However, the effect of demographic factors was not considered under moderating effect. Therefore, to determine the impact of demographic parameters like education, income, or age, future researchers could incorporate the concept of moderator analysis into the existing conceptual model. Fourthly, just four independent variables—Subjective Norm, Effort Expectancy, Facilitating Conditions, and Perceived Behavioural Control—have been taken into account in the current study. If additional factors like risk perception, moral responsibilities, and confidence could be considered in the future, that would be advantageous. 
<p align="justify">
Moreover, this study was conducted from consumer’s perspective only. Future study, however, may also take into account the respected opinions of other stakeholders, including regulatory agencies, solar providers, energy consultants, and financial institutions. Finally, it would be interesting to undertake a cost-benefit analysis and levelized cost of energy in future studies.
